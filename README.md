> [Advent of Code is](https://adventofcode.com/about) an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a 
variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming 
language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company 
training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
